== Kafka on the Edge: IoT scenario with OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka

This demo illustrates how you you can use a Kafka cloud service like OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka to build IoT solutions.

In this demo, you use a collection of smart parking meters situated in the city of Los Angeles which send out MQTT messages about their status to a MQTT broker. These messages are pushed to a Kafka topic resulting in a stream of parking meters updates. Using Kafka Streams, this stream is enriched and aggregated and used for real-time analysis.

[NOTE]
====
This demo and its components _are not_ affiliated with the City of Los Angeles - this is a hypothetical scenario.

The demo _does_ use a public data set data scraped from link:https://geohub.lacity.org[City of Los Angeles GeoHub APIs, window="_blank"].
